 ## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
 - Name: The user's name
 - Age: The user's age
 - Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
 - Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
 - Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours

// Created constant: Name and printed out a message
let name = "Emily"
print ("I chose name as a constant because Emily's name isn't going to change at all.")
// Created constant: Age and printed out a message
let age = 17
print ("I chose age as a constant because the age of a person will not change in one execution.")
// Created variable: Steps and printed out a message
var steps = 4000
print ("I chose steps as a variable because I need to constantly change the value to update the number of steps Emily has taken today.")
// Created constant: stepsGoal and printed out a message
let stepsGoal = 5000
print ("I chose stepsGoal as a constant becuase Emily's goal is unlikely to change soon.")
// Created variable: heartRate and printed out a message
var heartRate = 120
print ("I chose heartRate as a variable because her average heart rate will chnage as time passes.")

/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
